# glitch
- glitch-keepalive: Pings itself to keep itself up. I would stll recommend uptimerobot too, because you would get a mail notification if something broke

- glitch-restart: Restarts the project on an set interval (scheduler that runs glitch's "refresh" command)

- node-helpers: generic javascript helpers

- remquire: async script injecting, only use when you know what you're doing
